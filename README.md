# Algo
I am committing the code for all the algo problems I solve (daily coding problems, hackerrank etc)
Please note that this may or may not be the most optimal solution. In some cases I may not handle all the exception/corner cases (like integer overflow). 
The commments in the solution will explain the problem, the solution and the complexities. 
Please let me know if you fund any errors.
