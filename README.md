# Algo
I am committing the code for all the algo problems I solve (daily coding problems, hackerrank etc). Please note that this may or may not be the most optimal solution and may have some errors. In some cases I may not handle all the exception/corner cases (like integer overflow). The comments in the solution will explain the problem, the solution and the complexities. Please let me know if you find any errors or if there are more optimal solutions.
